# üêõ Voice Report Debug UI Guide

## Overview

A debug panel has been added to the Voice Report button to help you see exactly what's happening during voice processing!

## How to Use

1. **Click the Voice Report button** (microphone icon)
2. **Click "Debug ‚ñ∂"** button below the microphone to open the debug panel
3. **Speak your incident report**
4. **Watch the debug panel** show each processing step in real-time!

## Debug Panel Features

### üìä **Real-Time Processing Steps**

The debug panel shows every step of the voice-to-incident pipeline:

1. **Voice Recognition Started** ‚úì
   - Shows when microphone starts listening

2. **Voice Captured** ‚úì
   - Displays the exact text transcribed from your voice
   - Shows: `Heard: "A tree is blocking the road on Cooper Street"`

3. **Gemini AI Parsing** ‚ü≥
   - Shows when data is being sent to Gemini AI
   - Processing indicator

4. **Gemini AI Response** ‚úì
   - Shows the parsed incident data
   - Displays confidence score
   - Click "View data" to see full JSON response:
     ```json
     {
       "incident_type": "hazard",
       "description": "Tree blocking road",
       "location_name": "Cooper Street",
       "severity": "medium",
       "confidence": 0.95
     }
     ```

5. **Geocoding** ‚ü≥
   - Shows when converting location name to coordinates
   - Displays location being searched

6. **Geocoding Success** ‚úì
   - Shows the resolved location with coordinates
   - Click "View data" to see lat/lng

7. **Submitting** ‚úì
   - Indicates opening the confirmation modal

### üé® **Color-Coded Status**

- **Green** ‚úì - Success (step completed successfully)
- **Yellow** ‚ü≥ - Processing (step in progress)
- **Red** ‚úó - Error (something went wrong)

### üìù **Log Details**

Each log entry shows:
- **Status icon** (‚úì, ‚ü≥, or ‚úó)
- **Step name** (what's happening)
- **Timestamp** (when it happened)
- **Message** (human-readable description)
- **View data** (expandable JSON details)

## Debug Panel Controls

### **Debug Toggle Button**
- Click "Debug ‚ñ∂" to open panel
- Click "Debug ‚ñº" to close panel
- Located below the microphone button

### **Clear Button**
- Click "Clear" to remove all logs
- Start fresh for next test
- Located in the top-right of debug panel

## Example Debug Flow

Here's what you'll see when reporting:

```
‚úì Voice Recognition Started       8:45:12 PM
  Listening for voice input...

‚úì Voice Captured                  8:45:15 PM
  Heard: "A tree is blocking the road on Cooper Street"
  [View data] { transcript: "A tree is blocking..." }

‚ü≥ Gemini AI Parsing              8:45:15 PM
  Sending to Gemini AI...

‚úì Gemini AI Response              8:45:17 PM
  Confidence: 95%
  [View data] { incident_type: "hazard", description: "Tree blocking road", ... }

‚ü≥ Geocoding                       8:45:17 PM
  Converting location to coordinates...
  [View data] { location_name: "Cooper Street" }

‚úì Geocoding Success               8:45:18 PM
  Location: Cooper Street, Dallas, TX, USA
  [View data] { lat: 32.7767, lng: -96.7970, ... }

‚úì Submitting                      8:45:18 PM
  Opening confirmation modal...
```

## Troubleshooting with Debug Panel

### Problem: Nothing happens after speaking

**Check debug panel for:**
- ‚úó No Speech Detected - Microphone didn't pick up audio
- ‚úó Permission Denied - Need to allow microphone access

### Problem: Wrong incident type detected

**Check debug panel for:**
- Look at "Gemini AI Response" data
- Check confidence score
- Review the transcript to see if voice was captured correctly

### Problem: Wrong location

**Check debug panel for:**
- "Geocoding" step to see what location was searched
- "Geocoding Success" to see what coordinates were found
- If geocoding failed, it shows error in red

### Problem: Low confidence warning

**Check debug panel for:**
- "Gemini AI Response" shows confidence score
- Low score means AI wasn't sure about parsing
- Review transcript for unclear speech

## Tips for Using Debug Panel

1. **Keep it open during testing** - See real-time updates
2. **Click "View data"** - Inspect full JSON responses
3. **Use "Clear"** - Start fresh between tests
4. **Check timestamps** - See how long each step takes
5. **Look for red errors** - Quickly identify problems
6. **Copy data from console** - All logs also appear in browser console

## Console Logging

All debug info is also logged to browser console:
- Press F12 to open Developer Tools
- Look for `[Voice Debug]` messages
- Full data objects are logged

## Debug Panel UI

- **Location**: Appears below Voice Report button
- **Max height**: 384px with scroll
- **Auto-scroll**: Newest logs at bottom
- **Collapsible**: Click Debug button to hide/show
- **Persistent**: Stays open between reports

## When to Use Debug Panel

### During Development:
- Testing voice recognition accuracy
- Debugging Gemini AI responses
- Checking geocoding results
- Verifying confidence scores
- Finding performance bottlenecks

### During Demos:
- Show how AI parsing works
- Demonstrate real-time processing
- Explain confidence scoring
- Showcase geocoding accuracy

### For Troubleshooting:
- User reports wrong location
- Voice not being recognized
- AI misclassifying incidents
- API errors or timeouts

## Advanced: Reading the Data

### Gemini AI Response Data:
```json
{
  "incident_type": "hazard",      // crime|accident|fire|medical|hazard|other
  "description": "Tree blocking road",  // Brief description
  "location_name": "Cooper Street",    // Extracted location
  "severity": "medium",           // low|medium|high|critical
  "confidence": 0.95              // 0.0 - 1.0 (95% confidence)
}
```

### Geocoding Success Data:
```json
{
  "lat": 32.7767,                 // Latitude
  "lng": -96.7970,                // Longitude
  "location_name": "Cooper Street, Dallas, TX, USA",  // Full address
  "confidence": 0.85              // Geocoding confidence
}
```

## Performance Monitoring

Watch the timestamps to see:
- **Voice capture**: Instant
- **Gemini AI**: ~1-3 seconds
- **Geocoding**: ~0.5-2 seconds
- **Total**: Usually under 5 seconds

## Debug Panel Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Click log item**: Expand/collapse data
- **Click "Clear"**: Remove all logs
- **Scroll**: View older logs
